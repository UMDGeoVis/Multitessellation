<H1>Box demo</H1>

This demo uses a magic lens on a 3D object.

<H3>How to run the demo</H3>

The demo is available in two versions:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>demo1</B>:
This demo requires a two-dimensional MT embedded in three dimensions,
with approximation errors associated with its tiles and 
normal vectors associated with its vertices.
<LI>
<B>demo3</B>:
This demo requires a two-dimensional MT embedded in three dimensions,
it uses the value of triangle areas (rather than approximation errors)
as a measure of accuracy.
</UL>
<P>

Let the MT be contained in a file named <TT>xxx.mtf</TT>,
tile errors be contained in file <TT>xxx.err</TT>, and vertex normals
be contained in file <TT>xxx.nrm</TT> (the last two files are needed 
only by demo1).
To run the demo, type:
<UL> <TT>demo1 xxx</TT> </UL>

For instance, try <TT>demo1 ../data/bunny</TT>.
<P>

To exit the demo, strike key "Q" or "q" when the focus is in one 
of the demo windows.

<H3>Inside the demo</H3>

The program extracts a triangle mesh that has a given approximation errror
inside a cubic box (the "magic lens"), and is arbitrarily coarse outside it.
The extraction parameters are:
<UL>
<LI> a focus condition s.t. active triangles are the ones intersecting a
     cubic box;
<LI> a resolution filter condition s.t. a triangle is feasible if its
     approximation error is below a given threshold.
</UL>

The user can move the box interactively, and can change the extraction
parameters. 
<P>

One windows is used for visualization:
<UL>
<LI>
  the whole surface is shown at the center of the window in an orthogonal
  projection from one of the six cardinal direction 
  (x, y, or z; positive or negative).
<LI>
  the box is shown in red, the active triangles of the object are
  drawn in jellow, the other triangles in white
<LI>
  the three axes of the reference system are shown (the x,y,z axis are
  drawn in red, green, blue respectively)
</UL>
The viewed scene can be rotated and zoomed as explained next.
<P>

Another window shows the available commmands for interacting with the
program.

<H3>User interaction</H3>

User interaction is done by pressing the following keys when the 
mouse focus is in one of the three windows of the program.

<H4>Box movement</H4>
<UL>
<LI>
  r/R: start moving the box in the negative and in the positive direction
  of the x axis (the red axis)
<LI>
  g/G: start moving the box in the negative and in the positive direction
  of the y axis (the green axis)
<LI>
  b/B: start moving the box in the negative and in the positive direction
  of the z axis (the blue axis)
<LI>
  end: stop moving the box
<LI>
  home: bring the box to its initial position and size
<LI>
  pageup / pagedown: increase/decrease the speed of the box
</UL>

<H4>Triangle mesh extraction</H4>
<UL>
<LI> e / E: switch extractor type (dynamic / local)
<LI> > / <: increase / decrease error threshold used inside the box
<LI> + / -: enlarge / shrink the box
</UL>

<H4>Drawing</H4>
<UL>
<LI> w / W: switch to wireframe style (hidden line)
<LI> f / F: switch to solid style, flat shading
<LI> s / S: switch to solid style, smooth shading (using vertex normals 
     provided in the MT - only for demo1)
<LI> i / o: zoom in / out
</UL>

<H4>Rotations and translations</H4>
<UL>
<LI> F1: switch between rotation and translation mode
<LI> left arrow / right arrow: 
     if rotation mode, rotate around the z axis of the scene
     (the green axis);
     if translation mode, move the scene horizontally
<LI> up arrow / down arrow: 
     if rotation mode, rotate around an axis parallel to the
     horizontal edge of the window;
     if translation mode, move the scene vertically
</UL>

<H4>Termination</H4>
<UL>
<LI> q / Q: quit
</UL>

<H3>Remarks</H3>

Visualization in hidden wireframe may sometimes produce artifacts
(dashed and dotted lines, or portions of lines not properly hidden).
