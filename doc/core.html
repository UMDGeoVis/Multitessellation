<A NAME="TILESET"></A>

<H3> <TT>MT_TileSetClass</TT> </H3>

Subclass of <TT><A HREF="#PERSISTENT">MT_PersistentClass</A></TT>.

<H4>Meaning</H4>

A class of objects made up of vertices and tiles.
Tiles are <TT>k</TT>-dimensional, and vertices are embedded in
<TT>d</TT>-dimensional space, for generic <TT>k</TT> and <TT>d</TT>.
The implementation sets an upper bound of <TT>10</TT> 
for <TT>k</TT> and <TT>d</TT>.

<H4>Constructor</H4>

Parameters: the dimension of the embedding space
(= number of coordinates for each vertex), and the dimension of the tiles
(= number of vertices for each tile, minus one).
The resulting tile set has no vertices and no tiles.
A tile set must read its contents from a file.

<H4>Functions</H4>

This class provides functions to access the geometry of vertices and tiles.
Vertices are described as tuples of coordinates, and tiles as tuples of
vertices.
Elements inside a tuple are indexed starting from zero.
Both vertices and tiles are referenced as <TT>MT_INDEX</TT>es.
Valid <TT>MT_INDEX</TT>es start from <TT>1</TT>, the value <TT>0</TT> 
(macro <TT>MT_NULL_INDEX</TT>) is used for denoting "no vertex" or "no tile".

<!-- (10.2) --><H2>Classes for extracting tesselations</H2>

<A NAME="COND"></A>

<H3> <TT>MT_CondClass</TT> </H3>

<H4>Meaning</H4>

A boolean function on the tiles of an MT. 
Conditions are used within an extractor for driving the extraction of
tesselations from an MT. 
It is an <B>abstract class</B>.
<P>

The condition can be interpreted as:
<UL>
<LI> a resolution condition (deciding when a tile is refined enough,
     called a <B>feasible tile</B>)
<LI> a focus condition (deciding when a tile is of interest,
     called an <B>active tile</B>).
</UL>

Subclasses of <TT>MT_CondClass</TT> implement specific resolution conditions
and focus conditions.
<P>

There are two modes for evaluating the condition:
<OL>
<LI> <B>loose</B> evaluation:
   used inside extraction algorithms
<LI> <B>strict</B> evaluation:
   used on the tiles of the extracted tesselation
</OL>

The loose evaluation assumes that the condition is applied to tiles that
are not at full resolution; thus, their spatial location can be slightly
different from the location of the object portion that they approximate.

The strict evaluation assumes that the condition is applied to tiles that
are - if not at full resolution - at a resolution considered as sufficient
by the application; thus, their distance from the represented object 
portion is negligible.
<P>

For instance, a condition selecting the tiles which contain a given
point, evaluated on an MT where each tile has an associated approximation
error measuring its distance from the object portion it represents:
<UL>
<LI> loose evaluation tests whether a tile "may contain" the point, taking
     also the error into account
<LI> strict evaluation is the standard point-in-tile test
</UL>

<H4>Functions</H4>

<UL>
<LI> <TT> int MT_EvalCond(MT_MultiTesselation m, MT_INDEX t, int flag)</TT>:
     evaluate the condition on a tile,
     return <TT>1</TT> if tile <TT>t</TT> satisfies the condition, 
     <TT>0</TT> otherwise.
     <TT>flag</TT> is either <TT>MT_LOOSE</TT> or <TT>MT_STRICT</TT>,
     and determines the evaluation mode.
<LI> <TT> int MT_IsGood(MT_MultiTesselation m)</TT>: 
     return <TT>1</TT> if this condition can be applied to MT <TT>m</TT>,
     <TT>0</TT> otherwise
     (some conditions may require MTs with tiles of a certain
     dimension, or embedded in a space of a certain dimension).
</UL>

<A NAME="EXTRACTOR"></A>

<H3> <TT>MT_ExtractorClass</TT> </H3>

Abstract class.

<H4>Meaning</H4>

A class of objects which extract tesselations from an MT given
a resolution filter condition and a focus condition.
<P>

<TT>MT_ExtractorClass</TT> has three subclasses which implement 
extraction through specific algorithms:
<UL>
<LI> <TT><B>MT_StaticExtractorClass: </B></TT> use the global static 
     extraction algorithm 
<LI> <TT><B>MT_DynamicExtractorClass: </B></TT> use the global dynamic
     extraction algorithm 
<LI> <TT><B>MT_LocalExtractorClass: </B></TT>
     use the local (static) extraction algorithm
</UL>

An extractor may output the extracted tesselation simply as a list of
tiles, or may also generate information about mutually adjacent tiles.
Reconstruction of adjacency links between extracted tiles is a feature
that must be set when creating the extractor. By default, it
is disabled.
<P>

An extractor may also generate statistics about the performance of the
extraction algorithm. Such feature may be enabled and disabled at run
time.

<H4>Constructor</H4>

Parameters: the MT from which tesselations will be extracted, and a boolean
flag specifying if the extractor must generate adjacency information for the
extracted tesselation (default = disabled).

<H4>Meaning</H4>

This class provides functions for recording the sequence updates performed on
a tesselation during a process of refinement or coarsening, and for building
an MT from such a sequence.
An update consists of deleting a set of tiles and creating another
set of tiles. The sequence of all updates is called a <B>history</B>.

<H4>Recording a history</H4>

The history is not kept in memory, but it is written on disk in some
temporary files.  This allows saving memory since it is supposed that the
primary process of refinement or simplification (that generates the updates)
needs quite a lot of memory. <P>

<!--
At the end of the recording process, one can either save the history in a file
to be used later, or convert it directly into an MT.
If the second option is chosen, it may be necessary to free all the auxiliary
data structures of the primary process of refinement/simplification in
order to gain sufficient memory.
-->

At the end of the recording process, one can convert the history into an MT.
Before that, it may be necessary to free all the auxiliary

<H4>Converting a history</H4>

<!--
We can build an MT either from a history just generated, or a history 
previously saved on disk in a file.
-->
First, the user must provide an <TT>MT_Multitesselation</TT> that 
will contain the result of MT construction. 
After the MT has been built, the building interface may be
deleted and the constructed MT is ready to be used, or to be written on
a file and used later by other programs.

Abstract class,

<H4>Meaning</H4>

An interface containing functions that must be added to the MT
building interface in order to record values (of some type that is not
specified at this level) associated with its vertices/tiles.
<P>

It provides functions for recording the attributes of tiles or vertices during
the evolution of a tesselation after a sequence of local modifications, and
for building attribute tables from such information.
<P>

Subclasses of <TT>MT_AttrBuildingInterfaceClass</TT> will 
record attributes of specific types.

An object of class <TT>MT_AttrBuildingInterfaceClass</TT> will not be used
alone. It will be used within a subclass of
<TT>MT_BuildingInterfaceClass</TT> in order to record attributes for the MT
that we want to build.

<H4>Recording attributes inside a history</H4>

The attribute building interface contains among its internal fields an 
auxiliary attribute table, which is used for reading/writing attribute 
values, thus abstracting from the specific type of attributes.
Attributes are saved on temporary files in order to
reduce memory requirements.
<P>

In subclasses, the auxiliary attribute table will point to an attribute
table, of a subclass of <TT>MT_AttrTableClass</TT>, corresponding to the
specific type of attribute.
<P>

Subclasses of <TT>MT_AttrBuildingInterfaceClass</TT> will provide functions
of the form <TT>MT_MakeAttr</TT> (with parameters that depend on the type 
of attribute) for recording the attribute of an MT entity.
<P>

The attribute for a vertex/tile does not need to be recorded at the same
moment when such vertex/tile is recorded in the MT history (through a 
call to <TT>MT_UseVertex</TT> and <TT>MT_MakeTile</TT>, respectively). 
It can be recorded at any time afterwards (as soon as the applicative
program knows it: for instance, in surface refinement vertex normal may be
known only at the end of the refinement), and it can be recorded more than
once for the same entity.
When converting the recorded attributes, just
one attribute will be kept for each entity (the last recorded one).
<P>

<!--
At the end of attribute recording, we can either build an attribute table
directly, or save the recorded attributes on a file to be used later.
-->

<H4>Building an attribute table</H4>

<!--
We can build an attribute table either from attributes just recorded,
or from attributes previously saved on a file.
-->
At the end of attribute recording, we can build an attribute table
from the recorded attributes.
Before this, the user must provide the attribute table to be built.
After having built the attribute table, the attribute building interface
can be deleted.

<!-- (10.4) --><H2>Classes for Predefined Attributes</H2>

The system provides predefined classes for implementing attributes
