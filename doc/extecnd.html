<!-- (8) --><H2>HOW TO DEFINE EXTRACTION CONDITIONS</H2>

A specific resolution condition or focus condition is a subclass of
<TT><A HREF="core.html#COND">MT_CondClass</A></TT>
that implements function <TT>MT_EvalCond</TT>.
<P>

We distinguish between two types of conditions:
<OL>
<LI> conditions that do not assume any MT feature 
<LI> conditions that apply just to MTs with certain features.
</OL>

<!-- (8.1) --><H3>Conditions that do not assume any MT feature</H3>

Simply define a subclass of 
<TT><A HREF="core.html#COND">MT_CondClass</A></TT> and implement function
<TT>MT_EvalCond</TT>.
<P>

Function <TT>MT_IsGood</TT> must be specialized if the condition requires some
property on the MT (e.g., tiles and/or embedding space of a certain
dimension).

<!-- (8.2) --><H3>Conditions that require some MT feature</H3>

We call <TT>YYY</TT> the feature required by a condition (e.g., <TT>YYY</TT> = tile
error).
Such condition must be evaluated on an MT <TT>m</TT> that belongs to
a subclass of the abstract class <TT>WithYYYClass</TT>,
defining the interface for that feature.
<P>

Function <TT>MT_EvalCond</TT>, called within the extractor, 
has an <TT>MT_MultiTesselation</TT> among its arguments.
The condition cannot access the functions of class <TT>WithYYYClass</TT>
(accessing the attribute) through such argument, even
if it points to <TT>m</TT> 
(which is actually of a subclass of <TT>WithYYYClass</TT>).
<P>

Therefore, the condition contains inside it a pointer to an object of
the abstract class <TT>WithYYYClass</TT>. 
We call the constructor of the condition with an MT <TT>m</TT> of any
subclass of <TT>WithYYYClass</TT>, which will be stored inside the condition
into the above pointer.
<P>

The condition must be used only in an extractor created on the same 
MT <TT>m</TT>. MT <TT>m</TT> is accessed in this way:
<UL>
<LI> the argument passed by the extractor to <TT>MT_EvalCond</TT> is used to
     see <TT>m</TT> as an object of class <TT>MT_MultiTesselationClass</TT>.
<LI> the internal copy is used to see <TT>m</TT> as an object of
     <TT>WithYYYClass</TT>, in order to access the feature <TT>YYY</TT> of
     <TT>m</TT>.
</UL>

<!-- (8.3) --><H3>Resolution Filter Conditions</H3>

A typical resolution condition imposes that some feature of a tile is 
within a given <B>threshold</B>. The feature may be:
<UL>
<LI> computed on-line within the condition (e.g., area of a triangle)
<LI> obtained from the MT which implements it (e.g., tile error)
</UL>

The system provides a class, 
called <TT><A HREF="exten.html#THRESHOLD">ThresholdClass</A></TT>, that, 
given a tile <TT>t</TT> in an MT, computes a float value on <TT>t</TT>.
Such value can be used within a resolution filter condition as a threshold
to constrain some feature of tile <TT>t</TT>.
<P>

A resolution filter condition will be a subclass of 
<TT><A HREF="core.html#COND">MT_CondClass</A></TT> that:
<UL>
<LI> contains internally a pointer to an object of class 
     <TT>ThresholdClass</TT>.
<LI> implements function <TT>MT_EvalCond</TT> by comparing the tile feature 
     with the value provided by the threshold.
</UL>

The constructor of the condition accepts a <TT>Threshold</TT>, thus we
can get conditions that apply different types of thresholds to the same tile
feature.
<P>

If the tile feature must be provided by the MT, the resolution filter
needs to contain internally a pointer to the abstract class defining 
the interface of the feature, and its constructor will also accept an
object of (a subclass of) that class.

<H4>An example</H4>

This resolution filter condition applies a threshold on the approximation
error of tiles.
It must be used on MTs that are subclasses
of <TT><A HREF="exten.html#WITHTILERR">MT_WithTileErrorClass</A></TT> 
and implement the function <TT>MT_TileError</TT>.

<PRE>
typedef class TileErrFilterClass * TileErrFilter;

class TileErrFilterClass : public MT_CondClass
{
  protected:
  
  /*  Explicit reference to the MT in order to access tile errors.  */             
  WithTileError my_mt;

  /*  The threshold imposed on tile errors.  */             
  Threshold my_thr;

  public:        

  /*  Return 1 if the error of the tile is <= the threshold value for
  that tile. Return 0 otherwise.  */             
  int MT_EvalCond(MT_MultiTesselation m, MT_INDEX t, int flag)
  {  return ( my_mt->TileError(t) < my_thr->ThresholdValue(m,t) );  }

  /*  Create a condition given the reference MT m and the threshold tr to
  be imposed on its tiles.  */             
  TileErrFilterClass(WithTileErrorClass * m, Threshold tr)
  {    my_mt = m;  my_thr = tr;  }
};               
</PRE>

<H4>Predefined resolution filter conditions</H4>

The system provides the following built-in filters:
<UL>
<LI> Thresholds giving:
 <UL>
 <LI>
   the same value on any tile <TT>t</TT> (uniform threshold), see class
   <TT><A HREF="exten.html#UNIFTHR"></A>UnifThresholdClass</TT>
 <LI>
   a value that depends on the distance of <TT>t</TT> 
   from a given point, see class
   <TT><A HREF="exten.html#PD2TRI">PDist2ThresholdOnTrianglesClass</A></TT>,
   <TT><A HREF="exten.html#PD3TRI">PDist3ThresholdOnTrianglesClass</A></TT>
   and 
   <TT><A HREF="exten.html#PD3TETRA">PDist3ThresholdOnTetrahedraClass</A></TT>.
 </UL>
<LI> Resolution filter conditions applying a threshold to:
 <UL>
 <LI>
   tile area (for triangles in 2D or 3D), see classes
   <TT><A HREF="exten.html#AREA2TRI">TriangleArea2FilterClass</A></TT>
   and
   <TT><A HREF="exten.html#AREA3TRI">TriangleArea3FilterClass</A></TT>.
 <LI>
   tile error (for MTs with errors), see class
   <TT><A HREF="exten.html#ERRFLT">TileErrFilterClass</A></TT>.
 <LI>
   radius of the circumcircle (for triangles in 2D or 3D), see classes
   <TT><A HREF="exten.html#CIRCUM2TRI">Circumradius2FilterClass</A></TT> 
   and
   <TT><A HREF="exten.html#CIRCUM3TRI">Circumradius3FilterClass</A></TT>.
 </UL>
</UL>

<!-- (8.4) --><H3>Focus conditions</H3>

A typical focus condition considers a tile as active if it intersects a
given entity in space.
<P>

We suggest to define focus conditions according to the following
guidelines:

<OL>
<LI> Define a class <TT>EEEClass</TT> implementing the given entity 
     (e.g., a point, a line, a box, a circle) with all the functions 
     needed to access and manipulate it
     (e.g., set/return the point coordinates, translate the point...).
<LI> Define the condition as a subclass of <TT>EEEClass</TT>
     and <TT><A HREF="core.html#COND">MT_CondClass</A></TT>.
</OL>

In the system, we have defined classes <TT>EEEClass</TT> which correspond
to entities in arbitrary 
dimensions with the dimension passed as an argument to the constructor.

Some of the conditions derived from a class <TT>EEEClass</TT> constrain the
corresponding entity to a certain dimension.

They also may require that the MT has some feature.

<H4>Strict and loose evaluation</H4>

Within a multiresolution model (like the MT), a tile <TT>t</TT> may be in
one of the following situations with respect to a spatial entity <TT>e</TT>:

<OL>
<LI> <TT>t</TT> intersects <TT>e</TT>
<LI> <TT>t</TT> does not intersect <TT>e</TT>, but it is still possible that
     another tile, representing 
     the same object portion as <TT>t</TT> at a higher resolution,
     intersects <TT>e</TT>
<LI> <TT>t</TT> does not intersect <TT>e</TT>, and certainly no tile representing
     the same object portion as <TT>t</TT> at a higher resolution may
     intersect <TT>e</TT>
</OL>

Indeed, a tile <TT>t</TT> at low resolution may be at a certain distance
from the object (due to a large geometric error in the approximation), thus
it may not intersect <TT>e</TT>, even if the object portion prepresented by
<TT>t</TT> intersects <TT>e</TT>.
In this case typically another tile <TT>t'</TT> exists, which refines
<TT>t</TT> at a higher resolution, such that <TT>t'</TT> intersect
<TT>e</TT>.
<P>

The strict evaluation mode of <TT>MT_EvalCond</TT> discriminates between
case 1 (tile considered as active) and cases 2,3 (tile considered as not
active).
It is used when evaluating the condition on the tiles of the extracted
tesselation.
Such tiles are already at the resolution desired by the application
program.
<P>

The loose evaluation mode discriminates between cases 1,2 (tile considered
as active) and case 3 (tile considered as not active).
It is used for evaluating the condition inside the extraction algorithms.
Such algorithms traverse also tiles which are not at the resolution desired
by the application, thus it is reasonable to temporarily report a 
possible intersection; the final decision between intersection
or no intersection will be taken when the algorithm arrives at a sufficient
resolution.
<P>

The following remarks are important:
<UL>
<LI> If a focus condition applies to an MT in which the dimension of
     tiles is the same as the dimension of the embedding space,
     then a tile is always at its proper spatial location, thus
     the loose and strict evaluation mode coincide.
<LI> The key for implementing the loose evaluation mode is the
     presence of an approximation error associated which each tile
     <TT>t</TT>.
     Such error must provide an estimate of the distance of <TT>t</TT>
     from the object.
     The loose evaluation returns 0 (i.e., impossible intersection)
     if the distance between <TT>t</TT> and 
     the focus entity <TT>e</TT> is larger than the error; otherwise,
     it returns 1 (i.e., existing or possible intersection).
</UL>

<H4>An example</H4>
 
We define a focus condition for 2-dimensional MTs embedded in 3D,
which returns true if a tile (i.e., a triangle) intersects a 
three-dimensional box.
In order to implement the loose evaluation mode, the condition
requires MTs having tile errors associated with them.
<P>

We first define a general class for a box in <TT>d</TT>-dimensions,
called <TT><A HREF="exten.html#BOX">BoxClass</A></TT>.

<PRE>
typedef class BoxClass * Box;

class BoxClass
{
  protected:
 
  /* Min and max coordinates of the box on each axis. Only the first d 
     positions of the arrays will be used if box is in d-dimensions. */
  float minF[MT_MAX_DIM];
  float maxF[MT_MAX_DIM];

  /* Number of coordinated of the embedding space. */
  int b_dim;

  public:

  /*  Return the number of coordinates of this box  */
  int BoxDim(void) {  return (b_dim);  }
          
  /*  Set the box position and dimensions. */
  void SetBox (float * min_coord, float * max_coord);

  /*  Specialized versions for 2- and 3-dimensional boxes  */
  void SetBox (float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2);
  void SetBox (float x1, float y1, float z1, float x2, float y2, float z2);

  /*  Return the box geometry.  */
  void TheBox (float ** min_coord, float ** max_coord);

  /*  Specialized versions for 2- and 3-dimensional boxes  */
   void TheBox (float *x1, float *y1, float *x2, float *y2);   
   void TheBox (float *x1, float *y1, float *z1,
                float *x2, float *y2, float *z2);
   
  /*  Create a d-dimensional box with the given min and max coordinates.  */
  BoxClass(int d, float * min_coord, float * max_coord);

  /*  Create a d-dimensional box of null size where both max and min
      coordinates are all zeroes.  */
   BoxClass(int d);
};
</PRE>

Then, we define a focus condition using a 3-dimensional box
(i.e., a cuboid) on 2-dimensional MTs embedded in a space of at least
three dimensions.
If the embedding space is more than 3-dimensional, only the first
three vertex coordinates are considered (i.e., the tiles are
projected into the <TT>x-y-z</TT> subspace).
<P>

A tile is active either if the interior of the tile intersects the box,
or if the boundary of the tile touches the box.
<P>

This focus set must be applied to MTs that are subclasses
of <TT>MT_WithTileErrorClass</TT> and implement the function
<TT>MT_TileError</TT>.
<P>

The focus condition, called
<TT><A HREF="exten.html#BOX3TRI">Box3FocusOnTrianglesClass</A></TT>,
is a subclass of <TT><A HREF="exten.html#BOX">BoxClass</A></TT> and
<TT><A HREF="core.html#COND">MT_CondClass</A></TT>. 
It creates itself as a box with three dimensions, and its constructor needs
an argument of type 
<TT><A HREF="exten.html#WITHTILERR">MT_WithTileError</A></TT>.
<P>

The loose evaluation mode of <TT>MT_EvalCond</TT> is implemented by testing
the intersection of the given tile with a box enlarged of an amount
equal to the tile error.

<PRE>
typedef class Box3FocusOnTrianglesClass * Box3FocusOnTriangles;

class Box3FocusOnTrianglesClass : public BoxClass, public MT_CondClass
{

  protected:
   
  /*  Explicit reference to the MT in order to access tile errors.  */
  WithTileError my_mt;
 
  public:

  /*  Constructors. Parameter m is the reference MT.  */
  Box3FocusOnTrianglesClass(WithTileError m,
                            float * min_coord, float * max_coord)
  : BoxClass(3, min_coord, max_coord)
  {  my_mt = m;  }

  Box3FocusOnTrianglesClass(WithTileError m, 
                float x1, float y1, float z1, float x2, float y2, float z2)
  : BoxClass(3)
  {
    SetBox(x1,y1,z1, x2,y2,z2);
    my_mt = m;             
  }   

  /*  Implementation of abstract function from superclass MT_CondClass.  */
  int MT_EvalCond(MT_MultiTesselation m, MT_INDEX t, int flag)
  {
    if (flag==MT_LOOSE)
    {  ... expand the box of an amount equal to my_mt->TileError(t) ...  }
    if (... triangle t intersects the box ...)  return 1;
    return 0;
  }
              
  /*  This condition requires 2-dimensional MTs embedded in at least 3D  */
  int MT_IsGood(MT_MultiTesselation m)
  {
     if ( (m->MT_TileDim() != 2) || (m->MT_VertexDim() < 3) ) return 0;
     return 1;
  }

};
