<!-- (4) --><H2>HOW TO BUILD A GENERIC MT</H2>

An MT is built by:
<OL>
<LI> Recording the history of a process that iteratively refines or
     coarsens a tesselation through local updates.
<LI> Converting such a history into an MT.
</OL>

The MT building interface (class 
<TT><A HREF="core.html#BUILDINTERF">MT_BuildingInterfaceClass</A></TT>) 
provides the functions for doing that.

<!-- (4.1) --><H3>History recording</H3>

The user program must provide a field of type <TT>MT_INDEX</TT> associated with each
vertex and each tile used in the process of refinement or coarsening.
Such fields will be used as arguments in the functions of the MT building
interface.
The program must not manipulate the <TT>MT_INDEX</TT> fields associated with 
vertices and tiles in other ways different from initialization and
their use in the functions of the MT building interface.
<P>

Here is a list of the operations to be added within a program for
iterative refinement or coarsening of a <TT>k</TT>-dimensional tesselation
embedded in <TT>d</TT> dimensions, in order to record its history.
<P>

<H4> At the beginning</H4>

<OL>
<LI> Load the initial tesselation and initialize the <TT>MT_INDEX</TT> field of every
     vertex and tile to <TT>MT_NULL_INDEX</TT>.
<LI> Call <TT>MT_StartHistory</TT>.
<LI> For each tile of the initial tesselation:
     <UL>
     <LI> for each vertex of such tile, call <TT>MT_UseVertex</TT>
     <LI> immediately next, call <TT>MT_MakeTile</TT> for this tile
     </UL>
<LI> Before starting to refine or coarsen the initial tesselation, call
     <TT>MT_EndUpdate</TT>.
</OL>

Operations 1 and 2 may be exchanged.

<H4>At each update operation</H4>

<OL>
<LI> For each tile removed from the current tesselation, call 
     <TT>MT_KillTile</TT>.
<LI> For each new vertex created, initialize its <TT>MT_INDEX</TT> field to
     <TT>MT_NULL_INDEX</TT>.
<LI> For each new tile created in the current tesselation:
     <UL>
     <LI> for each vertex of such tile, call <TT>MT_UseVertex</TT>
     <LI> immediately next, call <TT>MT_MakeTile</TT> for this tile
     </UL>
<LI> At the end of the update, call <TT>MT_EndUpdate</TT>.
</OL>

Operations 1,2,3 can be executed in a mixed order, provided that:
<UL>
<LI> If a vertex is new, <TT>MT_UseVertex</TT> is called on it after having
     initialized its <TT>MT_INDEX</TT> field to <TT>MT_NULL_INDEX</TT>.
<LI> A call to <TT>MT_MakeTile</TT> is preceded by <TT>k</TT>
     calls to <TT>MT_UseVertex</TT>,
     one for each of the k vertices of the tile.
<LI> The calls to <TT>MT_KillTile</TT> and <TT>MT_MakeTile</TT> 
     within the same update may be interleaved.
     It is allowed to Make first, and then Kill the same tile within an
     update (these "temporary tiles" typically occur in algorithms that
     apply a process of local optimization within the updated area).  The
     building interface will recognize temporary tiles and remove them from
     the history.
</UL>

<H4>At the end</H4>

<OL>
<LI> For each tile of the final tesselation, call <TT>MT_KillTile</TT>.
<LI> Then, call <TT>MT_EndUpdate</TT>.
<LI> Finally, call <TT>MT_EndHistory</TT>.
</OL>

<!-- (4.2) --><H3>History conversion</H3>

History conversion is the operation that builds an MT from a 
recorded history.
<P>

<!--
Once a history has been recorded, we have two options:
<OL>
<LI> building an MT directly
<LI> writing the history on a file and read such file later 
     to build an MT
</OL>
-->

<!-- 
In the first case, 
-->

It is recommended to free all data structures used
by the refinement or simplification process before building the MT.
In fact, there may not be enough memory to hold both such structures
and the MT.
<P>

Here is a list of operations to be performed in order to convert a
recorded history into an MT.

<OL>
<LI> Create an MT and connect it to the building interface
     by calling function <TT>MT_SetTarget</TT>.
<LI> Then, call function <TT>MT_Convert</TT>.
<LI> Now, the MT
     has been built and it is ready to be used. The building interface is
     no longer needed and may be deleted.
</OL>

<!--
For deferred construction, call function MT_Write of the building interface.
This saves the history on file.
In order to build the target MT from such history, call function MT_Read
of the building interface. Now, the MT
has been built and it is ready to be used. The building interface is
no longer needed and may be freed.
-->

<!-- (4.3) --><H3>An example</H3>

We provide here the template of a program that records a history of an
iterative process of refinement of a surface mesh and builds a
two-dimensional MT embedded in 3D.
<!--
 by using
both alternatives (i.e., either directly, or by passing through a
history file).
-->
Recording a process of coarsening is identical, simply the parameter
passed to function <TT>MT_StartHistory</TT> is <TT>MT_COARSENING</TT> 
instead of <TT>MT_REFINING</TT>.
<P>

We assume that, given a vertex <TT>V</TT> of the current tesselation 
within the user program, the <TT>MT_INDEX</TT> field associated with 
<TT>V</TT> is named <TT>V.index</TT>;
and, given a tile <TT>T</TT>, the <TT>MT_INDEX</TT> field associated with 
<TT>T</TT> is named <TT>T.index</TT>.
<P>
