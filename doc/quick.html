<TITLE>The MT (Multi-Tesselation) Package - Quick Guide</TITLE>

<BODY>

<H1>Quick Guide to the MT Package</H1>

This is just a list of the activities you can tackle with the MT Package, 
sorted by increasing complexity. 
<BR>
For more detailed instructions see the
<A HREF="index.html#DOCUMENT">
on-line documentation</A> (also included in the package). 

<H2>See the demos</H2>

Once you have downloaded and installed the MT Package, you can immediately 
run the demos on the test datasets.
Demos are contained in directory <TT>MT/demo</TT>:

<UL>
<LI>
 For a demo to <B>fly over a terrain</B>, see the instructions
 <A HREF="demo2.html"></A>here</A>.
 <P>
<LI>
 For a demo to <B>use a magic lens on a 3D object</B>, see the instructions
 <A HREF="demo1and3.html"></A>here</A>.    
</UL>

<H2>Download already-constructed models</H2>

<P>
Some MTs representing terrains and free-form surfaces in 3D space
are already available. You have just to 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.disi.unige.it/person/MagilloP/MT_SW/DATA/datasets.html">
download them</A>. <FONT COLOR="AA0055">(external site)</FONT> </P>


<H2>Make your own models</H2>

Do you have either terrain data or surface meshes? 
Try to use our programs to build the MT representation of your data and see 
them through our demos.
<UL>
<LI>
 For building an MT for a <B>terrain</B> given a set of
 <B>scattered points</B>, you can use programs released within
 <FONT COLOR="AA0055"><B>MT_DELAUNAY</B></FONT>.
 <P>
<LI>
 You can also build an MT for a <B>terrain</B> represented by a 
 <B>triangular mesh</B>, or by a <B>regular square grid</B>, again
 by using <FONT COLOR="AA0055"><B>MT_DELAUNAY</B></FONT>.
 <P>
<LI>
 For building an MT for a <B>3D object</B> represented by a 
 <B>triangular mesh</B>, you can use a program developed 
 by IMATI-CNR, Genova.
</UL>

<H2>Make your own builder</H2>

You don't like the way our programs build the MT? You think you have a better 
simplification program? Try to modify your program to make a new MT builder.
<BR>
Just follow instructions <A HREF="corebld.html"> here</A>.

<H2>Modify extraction conditions in the demos</H2>

Do you like to extract meshes with a different threshold function and/or 
focus set? Try to define your own extraction conditions and modify our demos
accordingly. Suppose you decide to modify demo <TT>demoX</TT>, where
<TT>X</TT> = 1,2.
<UL>
<LI>
 See <A HREF="extecnd.html">
 here</A> how to define yor own extraction condition;
 otherwise, you can try some of the 
 <A HREF="exten.html#THRESHOLD">predefined conditions</A>
 provided in the package.
<LI>
 Edit the file <TT>demoX.h</TT> to link your conditions to the demo;
<LI>
 Define variables <TT>focus</TT> (focus condition) and <TT>filter</TT> 
 (resolution filter condition) of the appropriate class in
 files <TT>demoX.h</TT> and <TT>demoX.c</TT>;
<LI>
 Decide how to initialize and modify your conditions within the demo;
 you have to edit functions <TT>startGame</TT>, <TT>advanceGame</TT>,
 and a few other functions declared in <TT>demoX.h</TT> (they are
 implemented in <TT>demoX.c</TT>).
<LI>
 Decide how to visualize your focus set; you have to edit 
 functions <TT>drawFocus</TT> in file <TT>demoXvis.c</TT>).
</UL>

<H2>Add your own attributes to the MT</H2>

Do you need different or more attributes on your models? 
Try to modify our programs to build and use an MT extended with attributes.
<UL>
<LI> See <A HREF="extedef.html">here</A> 
     how to define an MT with attributes;
<LI> See <A HREF="extebld.html">here</A> 
     how to build it (you can modify your/our builder);
<LI> See <A HREF="exteuse.html">here</A>
     how to use it (you can modify our demos).
</UL>

<H2>Build your own application</H2>

Now you are ready to design an application that handles meshes with the 
attributes you need, and manages multiresolution the way you need. 
In order to do this you have to:  
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="extedef.html">Define an MT</A> with the attributes you need; 
<LI> <A HREF="extebld.html">Build it</A>;
<LI> <A HREF="extecnd.html">
 Define extraction conditions </A> that can be applied on this MT;
<LI> Design your own application program and GUI: you can either modify our 
 demos, or design it from scratch, by any GUI and graphics API you like;
<LI> In the context of your application,  
 <A HREF="exteuse.html">use the MT</A>
 to extract meshes at the level of detail you need.
</UL>
