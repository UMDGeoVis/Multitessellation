<!-- (5) --><H2>HOW TO USE A GENERIC MT</H2>

An MT is used for extracting tesselations at variable resolution from it.
Such tesselations will then be processed in some way 
within the application program.
<P>

For extracting a tesselations at variable resolution from an MT, we need:
<OL>
<LI> An <A HREF="core.html#EXTRACTOR">extractor</A>, 
     chosen among the available ones:
     static extractor, dynamic extractor, local extractor
     (class <TT>MT_StaticExtractorClass, MT_DynamictractorClass,
     MT_LocaltractorClass</TT>, respectively).
<LI> A resolution filter condition and/or a focus condition
     (subclasses of <TT><A HREF="core.html#COND">MT_CondClass</A></TT>).
</OL>

The first two types of extractors generate a tesselation covering the
whole object, where active tiles satisfy the resolution filter.
The local extractor generates a tesselation restricted
to active tiles, such that all such tiles satisfy the resolution filter.
<P>

<!-- (5.1) --><H3>How to choose the extractor</H3>

<H4>Static vs. dynamic extractor</H4>

The <B>static extractor</B> needs less memory than the dynamic one.
It is good for applications which perform few extraction queries, or
with query parameters that vary considerably between two consecutive
queries.
<P>

The <B>dynamic extractor</B> is more efficient for applications 
in which the query parameters vary gradually between two consecutive
queries.
In this case, it is faster to modify the solution of the previous query
into the solution of the next query, than recomputing it by scratch.

<H4>Local vs. dynamic extractor</H4>

The <B>local extractor</B> is recommended for applications in which the
focus set is very selective, i.e., active tiles cover a small portion
of the spatial object described by the MT.
<P>

In application that are interested in processing just active
tiles, the dynamic extractor has the disadvantage of generating 
a tesselation covering the whole object.
On the other hand, the local extractor works with a static approach. 
Thus, in applications in which the focus set is not very selective, and
query parameters change gradually from query to query, 
the <B>dynamic extractor</B> may still be faster than the local one.

<!-- (5.2) --><H3>Guidelines</H3>

In order to extract a tesselation from an MT, an application program
must perform the following operations:

<OL>
<LI> Create and MT and initialize it (typically, by reading it from a file).
<LI> Create an extractor, of the suitable class, for that MT.
     When creating the extractor, it is possible to enable the
     <B>generation of tile-to-tile adjacency links</B>
     in extracted tesselations,
     if this feature is useful within the application program.
     By default, adjacency generation is disabled since it is a
     time-consuming operation.
<LI> Create a suitable resolution filter condition
     and associate it with the extractor by calling function
     <TT>MT_SetFilter</TT>.
<LI> Create a suitable focus condition
     and associate it with the extractor by calling function
     <TT>MT_SetFocus</TT>. 
<LI> Call <TT>MT_ExtractTesselation</TT>.
<LI> Call either <TT>MT_ExtractedTiles</TT> to get the active tiles of 
     the resulting tesselation, or <TT>MT_AllExtractedTiles</TT> to get 
     all the tiles of the resulting tesselation.
     The <TT>MT_INDEX</TT>es of such tiles are returned into an array.
<LI> Access the arrays to find the geometry (and, if enabled, the
     adjacency information) for each extracted tile:
     <UL>
     <LI> The <TT>MT_INDEX</TT>es of the vertices of a tile are returned
          by functions <TT>MT_TileVertices</TT> (direct reference to the
          array of tile vertices within the MT),
          <TT>MT_CopyTileVertices</TT> (copy of such array),
          <TT>MT_TileVertex</TT> (return a single vertex) of the MT.
     <LI> Given the <TT>MT_INDEX</TT> of a vertex, its coordinates are 
          returned by functions <TT>MT_VertexCoords</TT> (direct reference to the
          array of vertex coordinates within the MT),
          <TT>MT_CopyVertexCoords</TT> (copy of such array),
          <TT>MT_VertexCoord</TT> (return a single coordinate), 
          <TT>MT_VertexX, MT_VertexY, MT_vertexZ</TT>
          (shortcuts for accessing the first three coordinates) of the MT.
     <LI> The <TT>MT_INDEX</TT>es of the adjacent tiles of a given tile are
          returned by function <TT>MT_TileAdj</TT> of the extractor.
     </UL>
</OL>

The user program may perform several extraction queries from the same
extractor by changing the resolution filter and/or the focus condition
between two successive queries.
<P>

The (resolution filter or focus) condition associated with an extractor
may be changed in two ways:
<OL>
<LI> By replacing it with another condition: create 
     another condition and call <TT>MT_SetFilter</TT> or <TT>MT_SetFocus</TT> 
     with such new condition.
<LI> By modifying the condition through its access functions (which 
     depend on the specific subclass of <TT>MT_CondClass</TT>): the
     extractor contains a direct reference to the condition, thus
     such modifications are visible within the extractor.
</OL>

<!-- (5.3) --><H3>An example</H3>

We provide here the template of a program that extracts tesselations 
form an MT.
In the example, a static extractor is used. A program using a dynamic
extractor or a local extractor is written in a similar way.
<P>

We assume that header files <TT>myfilter.h</TT> and 
<TT>myfocus.h</TT> define the 
resolution filter condition and the focus condition needed by the
application, as two subclasses of <TT>MT_CondClass</TT> named
<TT>MyFilterCondClass</TT> and <TT>MyFocusCondClass</TT>, respectively.
Names <TT>MyFilterCond</TT> and <TT>MyFocusCond</TT> denote 
the pointer types to such classes.
<P>
