<!-- (9) --><H2>HOW TO USE AN MT WITH A CERTAIN SET OF FEATURES</H2>

An MT is used for extracting tesselations at variable resolution from it.
We have already provided <A HREF="coreuse.html">general guidelines</A> for
the extraction of tesselations from an MT.
Now, we provide more details about the setting of extraction conditions.
Typically, in an MT with features, extraction conditions refer to 
such features.
(you can find <A HREF="extecnd.html">here</A> guidelines for the definition 
of feature-based conditions) .
<P>

<!-- (9.1) --><H3>Guidelines</H3>

We assume that our MT has feature <TT>YYY</TT>, i.e., it belongs to a subclass
<TT>MyClass</TT> of <TT>WithYYYClass</TT> and of
<TT>MT_MultiTesselationClass</TT>.
<BR>
See also the <A HREF="extedef.html">guidelines</A> for defining MTs 
with specific features.
<P>

Our resolution filter and focus condition belong to a subclass
<TT>MyFilterClass</TT> and <TT>MyFocusClass</TT>, respectively, of
<TT>MT_CondClass</TT> that uses feature <TT>YYY</TT>. 
Therefore, the constructors of class <TT>MyFilterClass</TT> and
<TT>MT_CondClass</TT> have an argument of class <TT>WithYYYClass</TT>.
<BR>
See also the <A HREF="extecnd.html">guidelines</A> for the definition 
of feature-based conditions.
<P>

With respect to the <A HREF="coreuse.html">template</A> 
already given for extraction of tesselation
from a plane MT, now we simply have to create the resolution filter and
the focus condition by passing the MT to the constructors of classes
<TT>MyFilterClass</TT> and <TT>MyFocusClass</TT>, respectively.

<!-- (9.2) --><H3>An example</H3>

In this example, the feature is the tile error.
We use an MT of class 
<TT><A HREF="exten.html#FIELDMT">FieldWithErrorClass</A></TT> (subclass of
<TT>WithTileErrorClass</TT>), a resolution filter of class 
<TT><A HREF="exten.html#ERRFLT">TileErrFilter</A></TT>
and a focus condition of class 
<TT><A HREF="exten.html#BOX3TRI">Box3FocusOnTrianglesClass</A></TT>.
