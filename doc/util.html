<H1>MT Utilities</H1>

A collection of utility programs for the MT.

<H2>Reverse</H2>

Program <TT>reverse</TT> reverses the orientation of an MT representing a
surface in three dimensions.

<UL>
<LI>
 Input: a two-dimemsional MT embedded in three dimension (triangles in 3D).
<LI>
 Output: a two-dimemsional MT embedded in three dimension (triangles in 3D).
<LI>
 Syntax: <TT>reverse input_mt output_mt</TT>
</UL>

The output MT is equal to the input MT, but all its triangles are reversed:
if the three vertices of a triangle T are sorted as A,B,C in the inout MT, 
then the vertices of T in the output MT are sorted as C,B,A.
<P>

This operation correspond to exchanging the inner and the outer sides
of the surface represented by the MT .

<H2>AddNorma</H2>
Program <TT>addnorma</TT> computes vertex normals for an MT representing a
surface in three dimensions.

<UL>
<LI>
 Input: a two-dimemsional MT embedded in three dimensions (triangles in 3D).
<LI>
 Output: a float vector attribute table (with vector lenght = 3)
 containing vertex normals for the given MT.
<LI>
 Syntax: <TT>addnorma mt_file normal_file</TT>
</UL>

Important: it is assumed that the tesselation at maximum resolution
available in the MT contains all the vertices of the MT. This is true for
Multi-Triangulation built through incremental insertion/deletion of
vertices, and for those built through edge collapse provided that the vertex
resulting from collapsing an edge coincides with one of the two edge
endpoints. 
<P>

Vertex normals are computed on the tesselation at maximum resolution
extracted from the MT.

<H2>MTbinary and MTascii</H2>

Programs <TT>mtbinary</TT> and <TT>mtascii</TT> convert an MT 
into BINARY and ASCII format, respectively.

<UL>
<LI> Input: an MT.
<LI> Output: the same MT written in binary/ascii format.
<LI> Syntax: <TT>mtbinary input_mt output_mt</TT> and
     <TT>mtascii input_mt output_mt</TT>
</UL>

<H2>Metadata</H2>

Program <TT>metadata</TT> compute for an MT the statistics defined by the 
<A HREF="http://visionair.ge.imati.cnr.it/ontologies/shapes/">Aim @
Shape</A>:<BR>
Mesh type: surface or volume,<BR>
Number of vertices at maximum resolution,<BR>
Number of tiles at maximum resolution,<BR>
Number of vertices at minimum resolution,<BR>
Number of tiles at minimum resolution,<BR>
Granularity: number of tiles involved in a single modification
to mesh resolution occurred during construction.
  A smaller granularity means that the multiresolution mesh is able to
  extract a wider variety of meshes at different resolutions.
</P>

<UL>
<LI> Input: an MT.
<LI> Output: statistical information, written to standard output.
<LI> Syntax: <TT>metadata mt_file</TT>
</UL>

<H2>Statistics</H2>

Program <TT>stats</TT> computes and prints statistical information
about an MT.

<UL>
<LI> Input: an MT.
<LI> Output: statistical information, written to standard output.
<LI> Syntax: <TT>stats mt_file</TT>
</UL>

Statistical information includes: 
total number of nodes, arcs, tiles and vertices in the MT;
number of tiles and vertices in the tesselations at minimum and
maximum resolution;
ratio between the total number of MT tiles and the number of
tiles at maximum resolution;
number of old and new triangles of a node of the MT;
number of incoming and outgoing arcs of a node of the MT;
maximum lenght of a path in the MT.
