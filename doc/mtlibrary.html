<H2>THE MT LIBRARY</H2>

<H3>Organization of code</H3>

The code of the MT libraries is written in ANSI C++.
The MT libraries are distributed open-source
under the <A HREF="license.html">GNU General Public License</A>.

<P>
The MT directory is organized as follows:

<PRE>
                             MT
                              |
        +-------+-----+-------+------+-----+

     include   src   demo    doc    lib   util
        |       |

</PRE>

<UL>
<LI> <B>include</B>: 
     header files for the MT libraries (kernel and extension).
<LI> <B>src</B>: source code for the MT libraries (kernel and extension).
<LI> <B>demo</B>: 
     a few programs demonstrating applications of the MT; 
     more programs will be added in the future.
<LI> <B>data</B>: files containing some MTs and related features 
     (tile errors, vertex normals).
<LI> <B>doc</B>: documentation (these html pages).
     The entry point is file <A HREF="index.html">index.html</A>.
<LI> <B>lib</B>: libraries resulting from compiling the kernel
     and the extension.
<LI> <B>util</B>: some utility programs</A>.
</UL>

<!-- <P>
The main directory is named <B>MT</B> here, while 
its name may vary depending on the release you are using 
(for Unix or for Windows).
</P> -->

<A NAME="SRCINCL">

<H3>Source code and header files</H3>

Subdirectory <B>src</B> and <B>include</B> are divided into:
<OL>
<LI><B>Kernel</B>:
    MT, extractors, building interface, basic attribute tables.
    <P>
<LI><B>Extensions</B>:
    specialized attributes and attribute tables, specialized building
    interfaces, customized MTs, customized extraction conditions.
    <P>
</OL>

<P>
Kernel and Extensions are composed of a hierarchy of C++ classes which
are compiled into two libraries.
<P>

<A NAME="KERNEL"></A>

<H4>Kernel</H4>

This is the standard MT library, containing classes for:
<UL>
<LI> The plain MT (without user-defined features), 
     and the related building interface;
<LI> The base class for extraction conditions;
<LI> The extractors (global static, global dynamic, local extractor);
<LI> Predefined attribute tables for storing ints, chars, floats, bits, and 
     vectors of such types.
</UL>

<A NAME="EXTEN"></A>

<H4>System extension</H4>

This part contains classes implementing:
<UL>
<LI> Features that can be added to an MT: tile errors, field values,
     vertex normals.
<LI> Customized MTs with one or more of such features,
     and related building interfaces.
<LI> Specialized extractions conditions, some of them referring to MTs
     having certain features.
</UL>

<P>

The classes here are provided as examples.
By using such examples as templates, you can define
your own customized MTs, building interfaces, and extraction conditions.
<P>

<A NAME="DEMO"></A>

<H3>Demos</H3>

We provide a few programs demonstrating the use of the MT.
<UL> 
<LI> A <A HREF="demo2.html">demo</A> for terrain MTs.
<LI> A <A HREF="demo1and3.html">demo</A> for two-dimensional MTs
     representing the boundary of a solid object in 3D.
</UL>
Most programs use OpenGL and Glut for graphical display.
More demos will be added in the future. 

<A NAME="DOCUM"></A>

<H3>Documentation</H3>

A copy of this on-line documentation is provided with the MT libraries.

<H3>MT files</H3>

<P>
MT files are text files containing an MT and its attributes.
<UL>
<LI>Some sample MTs, sufficient for running the demos,
are included within the MT libraries
(within sub-directories of directory <B>demo</B>).
<LI>More MTs can be downloaded separately and put into
directory <B>data</B>.
</UL>
</P>

<A NAME="UTIL"></A>

<H3>Utilities</H3>

We provide a few utility programs manipulating an MT:
<UL>
<LI>
 for reversing the orientation of triangles in a two-dimemsional MT
<LI>
 for computing vertex normals in a two-dimemsional MT
<LI>
 for converting an MT file into either ASCII or BINARY format
<LI>
 for computing statistical information on an MT
</UL>

You can find more information on such utility programs
<A HREF="util.html">here</A>.
